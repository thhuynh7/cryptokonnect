# About this Project
This projectâ€™s objective is to create a web application about crypto. This web app will be a reference point for crypto investors and traders to keep track of market movements regardless of geographic boundaries; it will also provide some support services including price alert, crypto wallet, and in-app chat function. 

Using this web app, users can save time on checking market prices from different sources and managing external digital wallets since all these tasks can be performed within this product.
